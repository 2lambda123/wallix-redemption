CAPTURE MODULES GUIDELINES
==========================

Capture modules are used to receive RDP drawing orders and execute them.
External user of capture modules sends time (heart-beat) informations when it pleases 
it. Now and then, depending of it's internal state, the capture module choose to create
some external output : take a snapshot picture, create movie frames, write timestamp to
file, send data to remote socket, etc.

The Capture modules configuration state is provided at construction time by the caller 
providing a specific CaptureConfig derived object, different for each kind of Capture 
backend.

The capture module may or may not be able to change parameters dynamically through calls
to the update_config method  

struct Capture : public RDPGraphicDevice
{
    Capture(const uint16_t width, const uint16_t height, const timeval & now, CaptureConfig & config){}
    virtual void update_config(const timeval & now, CaptureConfig & config){}
    virtual void snapshot(const timeval & now){}
}
